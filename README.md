# FTX

FTX is a total games won counter for Free Play games ("First to X") format in Puyo Puyo Tetris. This format is usually used for professional matches. This solves the problem of having to count the wins manually, usually in Twitch stream chat. The tool is extremely lightweight and can easily integrate into any livestream with OBS Window Capture.
