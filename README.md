# PPT Tools (DEPRECATED)

These were my first effort on reverse engineering PPT, I've learned better since then, however other solutions have surpassed me and I have no interest in continuing this project. See https://github.com/bayoen.

Puyo Puyo Tetris tools enhance your streaming or playing experience by providing you with useful statistics about your gameplay. 

## FTX

FTX is a total games won counter for Free Play games ("First to X") format. This format is usually used for professional matches. This solves the problem of having to count the wins manually, usually in Twitch stream chat.

## PPS

PPS (pieces per second) counter for Tetris in Sprint, Solo and Online games. This allows streamers and competitors to track their in-game speed, follow their progress as they get faster and generally to show off.

## APM

APM (attack per minute) counter for Tetris in Solo and Online games. This allows streamers and competitors to track their damange output, mostly to see how effective their gameplay actually is.
